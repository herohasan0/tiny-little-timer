## How It Works

The timer uses a 45-minute (2700 seconds) countdown that can be controlled with simple clicks:

- **Single click**: Start the timer if it's not running, or pause it if it's running
- **Double click**: Reset the timer back to 45:00
- **Visual feedback**: The background gradient fills from left to right as time progresses
- **Completion**: When the timer reaches 0:00, confetti appears and the cycle is recorded
- **Statistics**: Click "see stats" to view your daily progress (completed cycles and total work time)

The app automatically saves your daily statistics to localStorage, so you can track your productivity over time.
